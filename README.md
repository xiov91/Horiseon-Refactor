Refactor Challenge 1

Welcome to my first Refactor! \o/

[You can view the deployed page here](https://xiov91.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/)

When you load up the page, it ought to look like this:

[Preview 1](preview1.png)
[Preview 2](preview2.png)
[Preview 3](preview3.png)

I've taken care to add alt attributes to the images, as well as changing many <div> sections into semantic HTML elements. The CSS page needed some reorganizing to my eye, so I took steps to put the stylesheet in a little better order. There were some other things, like missing titles, that I cleaned up as well. Hopefully this is suitable, but I'm always open to making more changes. Thank you! :)
